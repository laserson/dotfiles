## Bootstrapping a server for fish shell

Install fish shell, then set it as the default shell:

```shell
sudo echo /usr/local/bin/fish >> /etc/shells
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish

fish

curl https://git.io/fisher --create-dirs -sLo ~/.config/fish/functions/fisher.fish
fisher add jethrokuan/z
fisher add edc/bass
fisher add laughedelic/pisces
fisher add rafaelrinaldi/pure

git checkout https://github.com/laserson/dotfiles.git
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish
cp dotfiles/config.fish ~/.config/fish
```

## Bootstrap Neovim config

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/autoload/
curl -fLo ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
cp init.vim ~/.config/nvim/
nvim +PlugInstall +qall
```
## Update dotfiles

Run `publish-dotfiles.sh`, whose contents is:

```shell
pushd ~/dotfiles
cp config.fish ~/.config/fish/
cp gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
cp gitignore_global ~/.gitignore
cp init.vim ~/.config/nvim
popd
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init fish
```



## Setting up a new MacOS machine

1.  Create ~/.ssh (700) and transfer ssh keys if necessary. (You can scp the
    files from one to the other.  Also transfer config.)

2.  Install homebrew. May require installing Apple's developer tools (Xcode) and
    Command Line Tools.

3.  Set computer name (under Sharing in System Preferences)

4.  Checkout this repo into ~/dotfiles.

5.  Install homebrew and homebrew cask packages listed below.

6.  Install Python using `install_conda.sh`.

7.  Install R and Rstudio.

8.  Install the "Hack" font.

9.  `mkdir ~/tmp`

10. Go through https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos to
    customize and execute. Diff it against the `macos` file currently in the
    repo.

11. Get Solarized theme for Terminal (maybe in mathiasbynens again)

12. Create symlink to Dropbox called `ul-dropbox`

## ssh agent

To add private ssh key to Keychain:

```bash
/usr/bin/ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Note the absolute path to use the OS X-supplied ssh-add which integrates with
Keychain.  If you installed openssh with homebrew, make sure that it's not
linked, or the homebrewed version will be run by default.

Modify the ~/.ssh/config file to add

```
Host *
  UseKeychain yes
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

with an `IdentityFile` line for each private key you want attempted.

## Insert ISO8601 date

Use the following Applescript in Automator with no input.

```applescript
on run {input, parameters}
	set date_string to do shell script "date +'%Y-%m-%d'"
	tell application "System Events" to keystroke date_string
	return input
end run
```
