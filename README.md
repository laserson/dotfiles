    repo.
11. Apply Solarized theme for Terminal in this directory.
12. Install Dropbox

## ssh agent

To add private ssh key to Keychain:

```bash
/usr/bin/ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Note the absolute path to use the OS X-supplied ssh-add which integrates with
Keychain.  If you installed openssh with homebrew, make sure that it's not
linked, or the homebrewed version will be run by default.

Modify the ~/.ssh/config file to add

```
Host *
  UseKeychain yes
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

with an `IdentityFile` line for each private key you want attempted.

	tell application "System Events" to keystroke date_string
	return input
end run
```
